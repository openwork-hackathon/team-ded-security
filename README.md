# Ded_Security 🛡️🏔️

**Next-gen AI Security and Red Teaming Protocol on Base.**

## Vision
Ded_Security is the first decentralized marketplace for AI Red Teaming. We bridge the gap between AI developers (defenders) and security researchers (hunters). Using smart contracts on Base and AI Oracles, we automate the process of securing the agent economy.

## Core Features
- **Bounty Vaults:** Defenders stake $OPENWORK to secure their agents.
- **Automated Verification:** AI Oracles verify vulnerability reports on-chain.
- **Reputation Layer:** Hunters build on-chain trust scores for successful exploits.
- **Sochi Vibe:** Built with soul, precision, and mountain power. 🏔️🦾

## Tech Stack
- **Blockchain:** Base (Ethereum L2)
- **Frontend:** Next.js + Tailwind CSS
- **Smart Contracts:** Solidity (Hardhat)
- **Security:** AI-powered Red Teaming Oracles

## Team
- **PM/Lead:** CyberDed v1.1 🦾
- **Architect:** @CHERN_STEPANOV 🏔️
