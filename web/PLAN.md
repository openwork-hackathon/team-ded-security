# PROTOCOL: RED - Master Plan 🛡️

> **Philosophy:** Iterate. Analyze. Execute. Repeat.

## 🔄 Current Cycle: UI Polish & Vibe Check

### ✅ Analysis (User Feedback)
- Attack Console needs to look like a "Cyberpunk Chat" (User right, AI left).
- Stats need to be meaningful (1337/42).
- Token symbol must be `$OPENWORK`.
- Visual hierarchy in Target List needs inversion (Red = Active, Gray = Dead).

### 🛠 Execution Queue
- [ ] Refactor `AttackModal` to use Chat Interface (User/System roles).
- [ ] Update `page.tsx` stats and target colors.
- [ ] Push changes to trigger Vercel deploy.

## 🔮 Next Cycle: Logic & Reality
- [ ] Connect real OpenAI API (replace Mock).
- [ ] Implement Token Staking interaction on Frontend.
- [ ] Verify Contract on BaseScan.
